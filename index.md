## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Getting Started

**Q: How do I create my first habit?**  
A: Tap the "+" button in the top right corner of the main screen. Follow the guided flow to set up your habit name, goal, days, and reminders.

**Q: How do I track my progress?**  
A: Swipe right on any habit in your list to mark progress. You can also view your weekly progress rings and detailed analytics in the Analytics tab.

**Q: What are rest days?**  
A: Rest days allow you to take a break from a habit without losing your streak. We believe rest is still productive! You can set rest days when creating or editing a habit.

### Subscriptions & Billing

**Q: How does the free trial work?**  
A: New users get a 7-day free trial. You can cancel anytime, but to avoid being charged, you must cancel at least 24 hours before your trial ends. We'll send you a reminder 2 days before your trial ends.

**Q: How do I cancel my subscription?**  
A: You can cancel your subscription anytime through your Apple ID account settings or through the "Manage Subscription" page in the app menu. To avoid being charged for the next billing period, cancel at least 24 hours before your current period ends. Here's how:
1. Open Settings on your iPhone
2. Tap your name at the top
3. Tap "Subscriptions"
4. Find "Angel Habs" and manage your subscription

Alternatively, you can access subscription management through Menu → Manage Subscription in the app.

**Q: Can I get a refund?**  
A: Refunds are handled by Apple. Please contact Apple Support for refund requests. We cannot process refunds directly.

**Q: What happens if I cancel my subscription?**  
A: Your subscription will auto-renew unless cancelled. If you cancel, you'll continue to have access until the end of your current billing period. After that, you'll need to resubscribe to continue using the app. Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period.

### Features & Functionality

**Q: What are challenges?**  
A: Challenges help you stay committed with a community of like-minded angels! Join preset challenges or create custom challenges with your habits.

**Q: How do I access meditations and affirmations?**  
A: Create a habit with "meditation" or "affirmation" in the name, then tap on it to access our special features.

**Q: Can I export my data?**  
A: Yes! Go to Menu → Privacy & Data Management → Export Data. You'll receive a JSON file with all your habits, progress, and challenges.

**Q: How do I reset my name and email?**  
A: Go to Menu → Reset name & email. This will clear your personalization information while preserving all your local habit data. Note: Angel Habs does not create traditional user accounts - all your habit data is stored locally on your device.

**Q: How do I delete all my data?**  
A: Go to Menu → Privacy & Data Management → Delete All Data. This will permanently delete all your habits, challenges, and progress. This action cannot be undone.

### Technical Issues

A: Yes! Once you've set up your habits, the app works completely offline. Your data is stored locally on your device.

### Privacy & Security

A: Yes. Your habit data is stored locally on your device using Core Data. We use industry-standard encryption and security practices.
